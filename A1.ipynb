        "The grading of the assignment will be based on the following categories:\n",
        "\n",
        "(1) **10 Pt - EXPLORATORY QUESTIONS** These are basic questions that in most cases can be answered without requiring a fully working and trained neural network model. For example, data loading, processing and visualization, summary statistics, data exploration, model and training setup, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "(2) **10 Pt - MODEL** Student has successfully implemented all the required neural network models and has demonstrated successful training of the model without any errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "(3) **10 Pt - RESULT** Students are evaluated based on the results achieved in comparison to the expected results of the assignment.\n",
        "\n",
        "(4) **10 Pt - DISCUSSION QUESTIONS** Student demonstrated understanding beyond the basic exploratory questions, can answer some of the more challenging questions, and provide arguments for their model selection decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "(5) **10 Pt - COMMUNICATION** Student has provided a quality submission that is easy to read without too many unnecessary output statements that distract the reading of the document. The code has been well commented and all the answers are communicated clearly and concisely.\n",
        "\n",
        "(6) **5 Pt - BONUS** Student has completed the assignment and has taken on the challenging bonus tasks listed in PART C. The student has demonstrated a good understanding of all aspects of the assignment and has exceeded expectations for the assignment.\n",
